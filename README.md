# Game Theory Applications

This repository contains multiple algorithms and simulations for solving game-theoretic problems. The code implements solutions for various game-theory-based challenges, including determining Pure Nash Equilibrium, evaluating strategies in decision games, and solving extensive-form games using backward induction. 

The repository includes the following problems and solutions:

### 1. **Pure Nash Equilibrium in Normal-Form Games (Problem 1)**  
   - **Objective**: To create an algorithm that identifies Pure Nash Equilibrium (Pure NE) for a 2-player normal-form game.
   - **Details**: The algorithm checks for the existence of Pure NE and returns all the Pure NEs for a given game setup. It can be tested using both manually entered payoffs or randomly generated payoffs.
   - **Features**: 
     - Input: Number of strategies for each player, choice of manually inputting payoffs or generating them randomly.
     - Output: All Pure Nash Equilibrium for the defined game.
   - **Example Results**:
     - Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and other scenarios with random and manually set payoffs.

### 2. **Pure Nash Equilibrium in Normal-Form Games with n Players (Homework 2 - Problem 1)**

- **Objective**: To create an algorithm that identifies Pure Nash Equilibria (Pure NE) in a normal-form game with **n
  players** (any finite number of strategies per player, up to 10 players).
- **Details**: The algorithm allows the user to define any finite normal-form game in terms of players, strategies,
  and payoffs. It can be tested with manually entered payoffs or randomly generated payoffs.
- **Features**:
    - Input: Number of players (max 10), strategies per player, payoffs (manual or random).
    - Output: All Pure Nash Equilibria for the defined game.
- **Example Results**:
    - User can test with different configurations, including games with up to 10 players and any combination of
      strategies.

### 3. **Completely Mixed Nash Equilibrium in 2-Player Games (Homework 2 - Problem 2)**

- **Objective**: To develop an algorithm that computes the completely mixed Nash Equilibrium (NE) of a 2-player,
  2-strategy game.
- **Details**: The user can input payoffs manually or let the computer generate them randomly. The algorithm then
  calculates the probabilities with which each player mixes between their two strategies (denoted x for Player 1 and y
  for Player 2) such that both players are indifferent between their strategies. The solution checks whether a fully
  mixed NE exists (all probabilities strictly between 0 and 1).
- **Features**:
    - Input: Payoffs entered manually or generated randomly.
    - Output: The completely mixed Nash Equilibrium, if it exists, including x and y probabilities for each player.
- **Example Results**:
    - For a randomly generated game, the algorithm outputs the mixing probabilities for Player 1 (x) and Player 2 (y).

### 4. **The Monty Hall Problem (Problem 2)**

- **Objective**: To simulate the Monty Hall game for different numbers of doors and evaluate the winning probabilities
  for two strategies: staying with the initial choice and switching to another door.
- **Details**: The game is simulated for various values of `N` (number of doors) and `K` (number of repetitions). The
  win probability is calculated for both strategies.
- **Features**:
    - Input: Number of doors (N) and number of repetitions (K).
    - Output: Probability of winning for both strategies.
- **Example Results**:
    - For `N = 3` doors, probabilities evolve from 20% (Stay) and 70% (Switch) for 10 repetitions to 33.15% (Stay) and
      66.80% (Switch) for 10,000 repetitions.

### 5. **Sub-game Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) in a Bargaining Game (Problem 3)**

- **Objective**: To analyze a simple bargaining game between two players involving dividing $10, determining the subgame
  perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE), and identifying non-SPNE Nash equilibrium.
- **Details**: The game involves Player 1 proposing a division, and Player 2 either accepting or rejecting it. The SPNE
  is found using backward induction.

### 6. **Backward Induction for Extensive-Form Games (Problem 4)**

- **Objective**: To solve general extensive-form games by backward induction to find the Subgame Perfect Nash
  Equilibrium (SPNE) and determine when the game will end.
- **Details**: The game alternates between two players, each deciding whether to stop or continue at each round. The
  payoffs are given as a sequence of choices, and the SPNE is computed.
- **Features**:
    - Input: Number of rounds and player payoffs.
    - Output: The round at which the game ends, which player stops, and the corresponding payoffs.

### Repository Features:

- **Executable Code**: Ready-to-run Python code for all game-theory problems.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Users can change game parameters, such as the number of strategies, rounds, and player
  payoffs.
- **Randomization**: Some problems include randomization options for generating payoffs.
